Weather_Now is a powerful web application that delivers accurate and precise weather information from anywhere around the world. With its simplicity and user-friendly interface, Weather_Now allows you to access real-time weather forecasts, atmospheric and sky conditions for any city in the world instantly, courtesy of the trusted OpenWeather API. The application is built using the Django framework on the back-end and complemented by Javascript, Bootstrap on the front-end. 

### Distinctiveness and Complexity:

Weather_Now is a application that look simple but actually it's a really complex application, the idea was to make application look simple, minimalist and easy to read for the user, for that the use of Html, Css and Javascript was key to make a much more dynamic user interface. 

Key Features:

1. **Show the Weather Info:** The application main function is to display on the screen the weather information of any city on planet earth that the user has entered into the search bar without refresh the page, that weather information is get it from a third-party weather information API and displayed using API Fech and Javascript.

2. **Change Mesure Units:** A feature that I find subtle but very important, is the color change that occurs when clicking on the temperature unit sign in the top of the page to indicate which mesure unit is being used, Celsius or Fahrenheit, and also change the temperature mesure unit sign in the weather information section without refresh the page, this characteristic was made using some Javascript logic staments like "if" and "else" to modify the behavior of some element depending on certain logic, and Javascript elements like the "eventListener" for the click event, the "getElementById" to get the element by id and change the color of the element and the "innerHtml" to change the text inside the element, in this case change the mesure units from Celsius (C) to Fahrenheit(F) or vice versa in the weather information section.

3. **Data Base:** In the back-end, the Django framework was use to create the application and the database, database was created using Python and django models to be used to store the credentials and information of the user account.

4. **Responsive:** The application use the Bootstrap framework to make the application responsive and easy to use in any device, its responsive design allows you to enjoy the same level of functionality and accuracy whether you're on a desktop, tablet, or smartphone.
