# weather_now üå¶Ô∏è

Weather_Now is a powerful web application that delivers accurate and precise weather information from anywhere around the world. With its simplicity and user-friendly interface, Weather_Now allows you to access real-time weather forecasts, atmospheric and sky conditions for any city in the world instantly, courtesy of the trusted OpenWeather API. The application is built using the Django framework on the back-end and complemented by Javascript, Bootstrap on the front-end.

### Distinctiveness and Complexity.

The app looks simple, but it is actually a very complex app, and it is different from the other apps because it uses real-time API calls to get the most updated weather information and it is displayed to the user instantly, showing different types of data that the API provides, such as temperature, humidity, the weather icon that changes depending on the sky conditions, whether it is cloudy or clear for example. The application is having a real and authentic communication with the third-party weather information API, unlike previous apps where API calls were not to an real API.The idea was to make the app look minimalistic and easy for the user to read, but at the same time have a really complex front-end and back-end that would allow the user to interact with the app more easily and dynamically, here are some of them:

**Key Features:**

1. **Show the Weather Info:** The application main function is to display on the screen the weather information of any city on planet earth that the user has entered into the search bar without refresh the page, to do that the app makes APIs call to a third-party weather information API to get the most updated information and displayed using API Fech and Javascript.

2. **Clean and Intuitive Interface:** The application is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, with a clean and minimalistic interface that allows the user to interact with the app more easily. this was done by a good structure and composition of the Html code of the pages and a good design of the page using Css, also Javascript was used to make the app more dynamic and interactive.

3. **Change Mesure Units:** One feature that I find subtle but very important is the color change that happens when you click on the temperature unit sign at the top of the page to indicate which unit of measurement is being used, Celsius or Fahrenheit, and also change the sign of the temperature unit of measurement in the weather information section without refreshing the page, this feature was made using some logical Javascript statements like "if" and "else" to modify the behavior of some element depending on some logic, and Javascript elements like the "eventListener" for the click event, the "getElementById" to get the element by id and change the color of the element and the "innerHtml" to change the text inside the element, in this case change the units of measure from Celsius (C) to Fahrenheit (F) or vice versa in the weather information section.

4. **User Registration:** On the back-end, the Django framework was used to create the application and the database, the database was created using Python and django models to store user account information and credentials.

5. **Responsive design:** The application use the Bootstrap framework to make the application responsive and easy to use in any device, its responsive design allows you to enjoy the same level of functionality and accuracy whether you're on a desktop, tablet, or smartphone.
